    question: "How is credit card interest calculated?",

    answer: "Credit card interest is typically calculated using a daily periodic rate (annual rate divided by 365) and applied to your average daily balance."

  },

  {

    question: "Why should I pay more than the minimum payment?",

    answer: "Paying only the minimum payment extends your repayment period and significantly increases the total interest paid. Increasing your monthly payment reduces both the payoff time and total interest."

  },

  {

    question: "How can I pay off my credit card debt faster?",

    answer: "To pay off credit card debt faster: 1) Pay more than the minimum payment, 2) Transfer to a lower interest rate card, 3) Stop using the card while paying it off, 4) Make bi-weekly payments instead of monthly."
